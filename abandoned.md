## Abandoned/Outdated Projects

- [yemekhane_rezervasyon_sistemi](https://github.com/bozdogan/yet_another_bootstrap_website)  
  Refectory reservation system for school cafeterias. Written in Java 8 using JavaFX user interface framework and MySQL database. It is no longer maintained.

- [boz_game_engine](https://github.com/bozdogan/boz_game_engine)  
  A rendering engine that uses perspective projection to render 3D objects.

- [quadtree_project](https://github.com/bozdogan/quadtree_project)  
  Visualization of Quadtree data structure. I originally intend to combine this with boz_game_engine to visualize Octree data structure. Never had the spare time to do it :/
  
- [yet_another_bootstrap_website](https://github.com/bozdogan/yet_another_bootstrap_website) ([*pages*](https://bozdogan.github.io/yet_another_bootstrap_website/)),  
  website1_0 ([*pages*](https://bozdogan.github.io/website1_0/)),  
  website2_0 ([*pages*](https://bozdogan.github.io/website2_0/))  
  
  These were Internet Programming assignments. Now they don't mean anything.

## Joke Projects

- [binary-coded_avatar](https://github.com/bozdogan/binary-coded_avatar)  
  A simple tool to teach myself to create bitmap images and use Java utilities to display and save it. It generates an *identicon* based on the input but instead of using it a seed, it makes the image directly from the binary code. I think it's a funny idea and actually my Github picture is made that way :)
