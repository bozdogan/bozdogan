Hi! My name is Bora. I do coding stuff. I mainly code in Java, Python and C. I'm also familiar with C#, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Go.

I have a lot of ideas and <del>sometimes</del> <ins>most of the time</ins> I don't have enough spare time to turn them into full-fledged projects. Here are some of them that've made it through:

- [asteroids_clone](https://github.com/bozdogan/asteroids_clone)  
  My attempt to make a functioning game from scratch. No libraries used other than SDL for rendering. Written in C with some small set of C++ features (like operator overloading). Developed using MSVC compiler.

- [chat-app](https://github.com/bozdogan/chat-app)  
  Real-time chatting application written in C# for desktop, featuring WinForms GUI and optional SQL Server database logging.

- [color-map](https://github.com/bozdogan/color-map)  
  School project. Coloring a map with no two neighbors using the same color. Written in Python.

- [nodetails](https://github.com/bozdogan/nodetails), [nodetails-website](https://github.com/bozdogan/nodetails-website)  
  Senior thesis. A layered text summarization tool using Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning. It consists of a server that runs the summarization engines, an API for querying the server and a web client to give user a convenient way to use our service. Back-end is written in Python Flask, Tensorflow framework is used for Machine Learning.

  My role in the small team of this project was engineering the Deep Learning process, coding the RESTful API for querying the server, and providing back-end engineering support for my teammates who coded the front-end UI/UX and prepared the presentations for the [Project Fair](https://mfprojefuari.eskisehir.edu.tr/14-proje-fuar%C4%B1-ve-yar%C4%B1%C5%9Fmas%C4%B1-08-haziran-2021-0).

## Back-End Projects

- [timestamp-api](https://github.com/bozdogan/timestamp-api)  
  A web API that converts the date between UTC time and UNIX timestamp.
- [file-metadata-api](https://github.com/bozdogan/file-metadata-api)  
  A web API that gives meta data on an uploaded file (like MIME type and size).
- [diceroll-api](https://github.com/bozdogan/diceroll-api)  
  A web API for multiple dice result. (Pseudo-random)

## Older Projects

Some of my older projects are now legacy as I don't maintain them and are not usable due to dependencies of older software. But I keep the code anyway. You can find them [here](./abandoned.md).
