Hi! Name's Bora. I do coding stuff. I have a lot of ideas and <del>sometimes</del> <ins>most of the time</ins> I don't have enough spare time to turn them into full-fledged projects. Here are some of them that've made it through:

- [asteroids_clone](https://github.com/bozdogan/asteroids_clone)  
  My attempt to make a functioning game from scratch. No libraries used other than SDL for rendering. Written in C with some small set of C++ features (like operator overloading). Developed using MSVC compiler.

- [chat-app](https://github.com/bozdogan/chat-app)  
  Real-time chatting application written in C# for desktop, featuring WinForms GUI and optional SQL Server database logging.

- [color-map](https://github.com/bozdogan/color-map)  
  School project. Coloring a map with no two neighbors using the same color. Written in Python.

- [nodetails](https://github.com/bozdogan/nodetails), [nodetails-website](https://github.com/bozdogan/nodetails-website)  
  Senior thesis. A layered text summarization tool using Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning. It consists of a server that runs the summarization engines, an API for querying the server and a web client to give user a convenient way to use our service. Back-end is written in Python Flask, Tensorflow framework is used for Machine Learning.

  My role in the small team of this project was engineering the Deep Learning process, coding the RESTful API for querying the server, and providing back-end engineering support for my teammates who coded the front-end UI/UX and prepared the presentations for the [Project Fair](https://mfprojefuari.eskisehir.edu.tr/14-proje-fuar%C4%B1-ve-yar%C4%B1%C5%9Fmas%C4%B1-08-haziran-2021-0).

## Abandoned/Outdated Projects

- [yemekhane_rezervasyon_sistemi](https://github.com/bozdogan/yet_another_bootstrap_website)  
  Refectory reservation system for school cafeterias. Written in Java 8 using JavaFX user interface framework and MySQL database. It is no longer maintained.

- [boz_game_engine](https://github.com/bozdogan/boz_game_engine)  
  A rendering engine that uses perspective projection to render 3D objects.

- [quadtree_project](https://github.com/bozdogan/quadtree_project)  
  Visualization of Quadtree data structure. I originally intend to combine this with boz_game_engine to visualize Octree data structure. Never had the spare time to do it :/
  
- [yet_another_bootstrap_website](https://github.com/bozdogan/yet_another_bootstrap_website) ([*pages*](https://bozdogan.github.io/yet_another_bootstrap_website/)),  
  website1_0 ([*pages*](https://bozdogan.github.io/website1_0/)),  
  website2_0 ([*pages*](https://bozdogan.github.io/website2_0/))  
  
  These were Internet Programming assignments. Now they don't mean anything.

## Joke Projects

- [binary-coded_avatar](https://github.com/bozdogan/binary-coded_avatar)  
  A simple tool to teach myself to create bitmap images and use Java utilities to display and save it. It generates an *identicon* based on the input but instead of using it a seed, it makes the image directly from the binary code. I think it's a funny idea and actually my Github picture is made that way :)
